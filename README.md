# Actually 1X1 for Beta 1.7.3 
A 1X1 Performance Texture pack for Beta 1.7.3. (It actually saves performance now :3)

## Installation Instructions
1. Locate your `.minecraft` folder `/home/x/.minecraft` on Linux, `%appdata%/.minecraft` on Windows or elsewhere if you are using a third-party Launcher.
2. Find your "texture packs" folder. 
3. Move the .zip from Releases to the directory.
And thats it :3

## Known Bugs:
Issue 1: Portals or fire don't have a 1x1 version (Coming in Release 1.1).
Issue 2: Some particles and blocks have larger size models but since they have been downscaled to 1x1 there isn't much I can do.
